typically has an oxygen content of 10% to 20% by
weight and a heating value of 30 to 35 MJ/kg, which
is superior to the bio-crude produced from thermal
pyrolysis. There is a potential for conversion of
surplus biomass residue into renewable transportation
fuels. HPCL is currently developing a technology for
converting biomass residue into drop-in fuels. Once
created, the technology will be demonstrated through
a tonnage-level demo unit. This technology will help
reduce India’s dependency on imported crude oil. HP-
HTL is a carbon-neutral technology; process scale-up
is in progress.

Carbon Capture Technologies
HP-HiGAS is a cutting-edge process intensification
technology developed by HPGRDC for gas treatment
applications. It has vast potential in carbon capture,
natural gas sweetening, refinery gas treatment,
and marine scrubbers. The technology leads to
significant equipment size reduction over conventional
columns and other benefits such as low capital
cost and improved safety. The first-of-its-kind
demonstration HP-HiGAS unit was set up at our HPCL
Visakh refinery to remove hydrogen sulphide from
refinery fuel gas, which has achieved ten times size
reduction vis-à-vis conventional column. As part of
its continuous technology efforts, HPGRDC is setting
up a 24-KTPA demonstration HP-HiGAS unit for
carbon dioxide capture from HGU process streams at
HPCL-Visakh Refinery.

HPGRDC has signed a technology partnership
agreement with M/s Kellogg Brown & Roots LLC,
USA, for global marketing and licencing of HP-HiGAS
technology, which has huge potential for use in carbon
capture (post-combustion applications).

Sector Enterprise (CPSE) based in Mangaluru with
equity of 16.96%.

HPCL is actively pursuing large-scale investments to
build petrochemical manufacturing capacities through
joint ventures and expanding its petrochemical
portfolio. India’s first integrated grassroots refinery of
9 MMTPA cum petrochemical complex of 2.4 MMTPA
is being set up by HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Limited
(HRRL), a joint venture Company between HPCL
and the Government of Rajasthan, at Pachpadra
in Balotra district of Rajasthan. HPCL anticipates a
unique opportunity to establish itself as a leading
polymer brand in the market through pre-marketing
polymers before the commissioning of the refinery

and petrochemical complex. The refinery-cum-
petrochemical complex has a petrochemical intensity
index of 26%, which is the highest in India. It will have
the flexibility to adjust its production mix according to
market demand or other factors. The project is in the
advanced stage of completion.
